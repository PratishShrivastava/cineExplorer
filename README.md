-- Movie Listing:
Display a list of movies on the homepage. Each movie should show essential information such as title, poster, and release date.

-- Search Functionality:
Implement a search bar that allows users to search for movies based on keywords, genres, or any other relevant criteria.

-- Movie Details:
Create a detailed view for each movie that includes additional information such as plot summary, cast, genre, and user ratings.

-- Filtering and Sorting:
Provide options for users to filter and sort the movie list based on different criteria, such as genre, release date, or ratings.

-- API Integration:
Fetch movie data from a public movie API, such as The Movie Database (TMDb) API. This will give you real movie data to work with in your application.

-- Responsive Design:
Ensure that your application is responsive and looks good on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

-- User Authentication (Optional):
Implement user authentication if you want to allow users to save their favorite movies, rate them, or create personalized lists.

-- Pagination:
Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle a large number of movies and improve the performance of your application.

-- Error Handling:
Handle errors gracefully, such as displaying a friendly message when a movie search doesn't return any results or when there is an issue with the API.

-- Testing:
Practice unit testing for your React components to ensure that they work as expected. You can use testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library for this purpose.

-- Routing:
Use React Router to implement navigation between the movie list, movie details, and any other relevant pages within your application.

-- Loading Indicators:
Include loading indicators or placeholders to provide feedback to users when the application is fetching data from the API.
